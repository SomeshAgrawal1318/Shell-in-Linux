# CSEShell

CSEShell is a simple, custom shell for Unix-based systems, designed to provide an interface for executing system programs. This project includes a basic shell implementation, a set of system programs (`find`, `ld`, `ldr`), and some test files.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `bin/` - Contains compiled executables for system programs.
  - `find` - Program to find files.
  - `ld` - Program for listing the contents of the current directory.
  - `ldr` - Program for listing the contents of the current directory recursively.
- `cseshell` - The main executable for the CSEShell.
- `files/` - Contains various test files used with the shell and system programs.
  - `combined.txt`, `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, ... - Test text files.
  - `notes.pdf` - A PDF file for testing.
  - `ss.png` - An image file.
- `makefile` - Makefile for building the CSEShell and system programs.
- `source/` - Source code for the shell and system programs.
  - `libs/` - Contain matching `foo.h` and `foo.c` helper functions, unit-testable.
  - `shell.c` and `shell.h` - Source and header files for the shell.
  - `system_programs/` - Source code and header for the system programs.
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests.
  - `unit/` - C unit tests using the Unity framework.
  - `integration/` - Bash scripts that run `./cseshell` as a black box.
  - `unity/` - Vendored Unity test framework (`unity.c`, `unity.h`, `unity_internals.h`).
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts, including the AI-assisted test generator.
- `prompts/` - Prompt templates used by the AI test generator.
- `AGENTS.md` - Guide for AI coding agents working in this project.

## Building the Project

To build the CSEShell and system programs, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source code and place the executable files in the appropriate directories.

## Running CSEShell

After building, you can start the shell by running:

```bash
./cseshell
```

From there, you can execute built-in commands and any of the included system programs (e.g., `find`, `ld`, `ldr`).

## Supported Builtin Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cd [dir]` | Change working directory. If no argument, prints the current directory. |
| `help` | List all builtin commands. |
| `exit` | Exit the shell. |
| `usage [command]` | Show usage help. No argument lists all builtins; with a name shows help for that command. |
| `env` | Print all current environment variables. |
| `setenv KEY=VALUE` | Set or modify an environment variable for this session. |
| `unsetenv KEY` | Remove an environment variable from this session. |
| `history` | Show the last 10 commands entered, numbered like bash history. |
| `lang [code]` | Show or switch the shell's display language (`en`, `zh`, `ms`, `ta`). |

## System Programs

- `find.c` - Searches for files in a directory.
- `ld.c` - List the contents of the current directory.
- `ldr.c` - List the contents of the current directory recursively.
- `sys.c` - Displays OS, kernel, user, CPU, and memory info.
- `dspawn.c` - Spawns a background daemon process that logs to `dspawn.log`.
- `dcheck.c` - Reports the number of active dspawn daemons.
- `backup.c` - Compresses the directory in `$BACKUP_DIR` into a dated archive.

## Additional Features

### Multilingual Support (`lang`)

CSEShell greets the user and can switch its display language between **English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil** — Singapore's four official languages. Type `lang` to see the options, or `lang <code>` to switch:

```
$$ lang
Current language: English (en)
Available languages:
  en - English
  zh - Chinese
  ms - Malay
  ta - Tamil
Use 'lang <code>' to switch.
$$ lang zh
欢迎使用 CSEShell！
$$ lang ta
CSEShell-க்கு வரவேற்கிறோம்!
```

**How it works**: the active language is stored in the `CSESHELL_LANG` environment variable (default `en`). The `shell_lang()` builtin validates the requested code, updates `CSESHELL_LANG` with `setenv()`, and greets in the new language. The startup banner shown by `print_welcome_message()` reads the same variable, so a language chosen at launch (`CSESHELL_LANG=ms ./cseshell`) is honoured immediately.

### Colored Prompt

The shell prompt shows `user@host:~/path$` in colour, updating on every command so it always reflects the current directory. Green for `user@host`, blue for the path — no configuration needed.

```
zeff@LAPTOP-ABC:~$ cd files
zeff@LAPTOP-ABC:~/cse_labs/2026-pa1-50005-snickers/files$ ld
...
zeff@LAPTOP-ABC:~/cse_labs/2026-pa1-50005-snickers/files$ cd ..
zeff@LAPTOP-ABC:~/cse_labs/2026-pa1-50005-snickers$
```

**How it works**: `type_prompt()` in `shell.c` calls `getpwuid(getuid())` for the username, `gethostname()` for the host (trimmed at the first `.`), and `getcwd()` for the path (with the `HOME` prefix replaced by `~`).

### Command History (`history`)

CSEShell keeps a running record of the last 10 commands entered. Type `history` at any time to see them listed with sequence numbers, just like in bash. The history wraps around once 10 entries are full so the most recent commands are always visible.

```
$$ ld
$$ cd files
$$ history
  1  ld
  2  cd files
  3  history
```

**How it works** (easy to explain in the demo):

1. `add_to_history(cmd)` in `shell.c` joins the command tokens back into a single string and stores it in a circular array of 10 slots.
2. This is called once per command from the main loop in `main.c`, before dispatch.
3. The `history` builtin iterates the array in order and prints each entry with its sequence number.

## Sustainability and Inclusivity

**Sustainability**: CSEShell is intentionally lightweight. It spawns no background threads and holds no persistent resources. The `dspawn` daemon writes to disk only every 10 seconds and terminates after 10 iterations rather than running indefinitely. The `backup` program produces compressed archives, keeping storage use low. No GUI or heavy framework dependencies are required — `make && ./cseshell` is the entire deployment.

**Inclusivity**: CSEShell ships with **multilingual support** — the `lang` builtin lets users run the shell in English, Chinese, Malay, or Tamil (Singapore's four official languages), making it usable by non-English-first users (see Additional Features above). Beyond language, error messages explain what went wrong and what to do next (e.g., `export BACKUP_DIR=...`) rather than printing numeric codes, and the `usage` builtin provides in-shell documentation for every command so users do not need to consult external man pages. *Future work*: translate the `help`/`usage` text and error messages into the selected language too, and add a `NO_COLOR` mode for screen-reader and colour-blind users.

Each program can be executed from the CSEShell once it is running. This starter code only allows the shell to execute a command once before exiting because `execv` replace the entire process' address space. Students need to fix this and allow the shell to prompt for more commands in Programming Assignment 1.

## Files Directory

The `files/` directory contains various text, PDF, and image files for testing the functionality of the CSEShell and its system programs.

## Makefile

The Makefile contains rules for compiling the shell and system programs. You can clean the build by running:

```bash
make clean
```

## Source Directory

Contains all the necessary source code for the shell and system programs. It is divided into the shell implementation (`shell.c`, `shell.h`) and system programs (`system_programs/`).

## Testing

This project ships with two layers of tests:

- **Unit tests** in `tests/unit/`. Small C programs that exercise pure helper functions directly, using the Unity framework. You can create any matching `test_foo.c` under `tests/unit` to test any libs under `source/libs/foo.c` by including the matching `source/libs/foo.h` header file in the unit test. See `tests/unit/test_perms.c` (or `test_rc_parser.c`) for example.
- **Integration tests** in `tests/integration/`. Bash scripts that run the compiled `./cseshell` as a subprocess, feed it `stdin`, and check `stdout`.
  - You should create your own integration tests. These samples given are just samples, adjust it accordingly.

Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

Run only unit tests:

```bash
make unit
```

Run only integration tests (requires that `make` has been run first so `cseshell` and the system program binaries exist):

```bash
make integration
```

For an explanation of what to test and how to structure your testable code, see the testing handout.

## Testing Note

### Unit tests

- **`test_perms.c`** — Tests `perms_to_string()` in `source/libs/perms.c`. Covers: empty mode (all dashes), a regular 0644 file, a directory 0755, and a file with only owner permissions. All 4 pass.
- **`test_rc_parser.c`** — Tests `classify_rc_line()` in `source/libs/rc_parser.c`. Covers: empty string, whitespace-only line, `PATH=value`, `PATH=` with no value, a line starting with `PATH` but no `=` (should be a command, not a PATH line), a plain command, and a command with leading whitespace. All 7 pass.

Functions not suited for unit testing here: `fork`/`execv` in the shell loop, daemon creation in `dspawn`, and any function that requires a real process or filesystem side effect.

### Integration tests

- **`test_exit.sh`** — `exit` terminates the shell cleanly within 3 s.
- **`test_loop.sh`** — Shell loops over multiple commands and survives an unknown command without crashing.
- **`test_builtin_help.sh`** — `help` lists all seven builtin commands.
- **`test_builtin_cd.sh`** — `cd files` followed by `ld` shows files inside that directory.
- **`test_builtin_env.sh`** — `setenv`/`env`/`unsetenv` round-trip: variable appears then disappears.
- **`test_system_programs_bundled.sh`** — `ld`, `ldr`, and `find` run through the shell and produce expected output.
- **`test_sys.sh`** — `sys` prints all five expected fields: OS, Kernel, User, CPU, Memory.
- **`test_dspawn.sh`** — `dspawn` returns control to the shell immediately (daemon detaches) and creates `dspawn.log` with a startup message.
- **`test_dcheck.sh`** — `dcheck` runs and prints the "Active dspawn daemons:" summary line.
- **`test_backup.sh`** — `backup` without `BACKUP_DIR` prints an error mentioning the variable; with `BACKUP_DIR=./files` it creates a `.tar.gz` file inside `archive/`.
- **`test_history.sh`** — runs `ld`, `cd files`, then `history`; checks that both previous commands appear in the numbered output.
- **`test_builtin_usage.sh`** — `usage` lists all builtins, and `usage cd` shows command-specific help.
- **`test_builtin_lang.sh`** — `lang` lists the four languages; `lang ms` and `lang zh` switch the greeting language.

### AI use
First four parts are hand written by a human. Later the humans got tired and then read below.

AI (Claude) assisted with: implementing the four Part 5 system programs (`sys`, `dspawn`, `dcheck`, `backup`), implementing `classify_rc_line`, the additional features (`history`, the colored prompt, and the multilingual `lang` builtin), writing integration tests for Part 5 and for the `history`/`usage`/`lang` features, and fixing two pre-existing bugs (`static` mismatch on `process_rc_file`, wrong include path in `TEST_CFLAGS`). All generated code was reviewed and understood before submission.

### AI-Assisted Unit Test Generation

This project includes an optional wrapper for drafting unit tests with an AI agent. After writing a helper, you can run:

```bash
make ai-unit-tests MODULE=<helper_name>
```

This invokes `scripts/gen_unit_tests.sh`, which builds a prompt from `prompts/generate-unit-tests.md` and `AGENTS.md`. The script either pipes the prompt to your configured agent (via the `CSESHELL_AGENT_CMD` environment variable) or prints it to stdout for you to paste into a chat interface. See `AGENTS.md` for setup details and the rules agents follow.

You remain responsible for every test in your submission. You must be able to explain each test during checkoff.
